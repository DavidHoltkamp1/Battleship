## Description

This is a project built with Ruby to create a terminal version of the popular board game Battleship. The user is presented with a prompt to either start or quit the game. Once the game starts the user will be given to ships to place at desired coordinates. Once ships are placed the user and cpu will take turns firing at cells. The cells will visually update to show whether the shot was a Hit, Miss, or a hit that Sunk the ship. Once a winner has been decided, the game will prompt you to either play again or quit.

Further knowledge on the following technologies/principles:

- Ruby
